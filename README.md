astexplorer-cue
==============

This wraps [Cue's parser](https://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go@v0.4.1/cue/parser)
with a JavaScript interface compiled to WASM.

It's not intended for general usage, but only as a wrapper for ASTExplorer

Thanks to Dan Snow for [astexplorer-go](https://github.com/DanSnow/astexplorer-go),
on which this project is based.
